# Competitive Programming Solutions

Welcome to my repository of competitive programming solutions! This repository contains my solutions to various coding problems from different platforms. Each problem's solution is provided in a separate C++ file.

## Instructions

### Prerequisites

To execute the C++ solutions in this repository, you need to have the following tools installed:

- [g++ compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
- Command-line environment (Terminal, Git Bash, etc.)

### Execution

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TheTharz/competitive-programming-solutions.git
2. Navigate to Problem Directory: Go to the directory of the specific problem you want to execute:

   ```bash
    cd competitive-programming-solutions/ProblemName

3. Compile and Run: Use the following commands to compile and run the solution:

   ```bash
    g++ -o solution solution.cpp
    ./solution
Replace solution with an appropriate output filename and solution.cpp with the C++ file containing the solution.

Input/Output: If the problem requires input, you can provide it through standard input. The program's output will be displayed in the terminal.

Contributing
Feel free to contribute by adding your own solutions, improving existing code, or providing better explanations. Make sure your code is well-documented and follows good coding practices.

Happy coding!
